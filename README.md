3. Reducer and Slice Implementation: The app makes use of reducers and slice reducers to efficiently manage different aspects of state within the application.
4. Local Storage: Previous search URLs are stored locally, allowing users to access and reuse past searches. Users can also click on a copy button to paste old URLs into the input field for revisiting.
